// The Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) is a widely used instrument designed to assess the fear and avoidance associated with social anxiety disorder (SAD). The LSAS consists of 24 items, divided into two subscales: 12 items measuring fear and 12 items measuring avoidance in social situations. Each item is scored on a scale from 0 to 3, where higher scores indicate greater levels of fear or avoidance.
